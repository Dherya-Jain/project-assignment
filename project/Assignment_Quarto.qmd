## ***Introduction***

***Access to safe drinking water is not a privilege, it's a fundamental human right***. Yet, for millions around the world, this essential need remains out of reach. *This dashboard delves into 12 years of data, revealing the stark reality of populations relying on improved, but not necessarily perfect, drinking water sources*. We'll explore not only the proportion of people with access to these sources, but also how this critical **factor impacts a fundamental metric of well-being: life expectancy at birth**. Understanding this connection is vital in the ongoing fight to ensure clean water for all.

## ***Significance of Life Expectancy***

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "To comprehend the profound influence of clean drinking water on public health, it is imperative to <span style='color:green'>**delve into the life expectancy**</span> rates across various countries. This map serves as a lens through which we can discern the stark disparities in life expectancy among continents. It becomes evident that the <span style='color:blue'>*European continent emerges prominently*</span> in <span style='color:blue'>*comparison to*</span> others, showcasing higher life expectancy rates. Conversely, the <span style='color:red'>*African and certain parts of the Asian continent*</span> exhibit significant <span style='color:red'>*deficits in life expectancy*</span>, mirroring the findings of the earlier map depicting access to clean drinking water. This <span style='color:purple'>***correlation***</span> underscores the robust link between access to <span style='color:purple'>***clean drinking water and life expectancy***</span>. In the subsequent sections of the report, we will embark on a more comprehensive exploration of this vital relationship."

## ![](cc.jpg){width="63"} ***Conclusion & Recommendations***

The analysis of 12 years of data underscores the critical importance of access to safe drinking water as a fundamental human right. While positive trends in improved water access are evident globally, persistent disparities remain, particularly in regions such as Africa. *The correlation between high life expectancy and access to clean water highlights the vital role clean water plays in promoting health and longevity*. The case of ***African continent*** illustrates the potential for targeted clean water initiatives to positively impact life expectancy in developing nations. This emphasizes the urgent need for concerted efforts to address inequalities in water access and prioritize initiatives that ensure clean water for all. As we move forward, it is imperative to recognize the interconnectedness of clean water access and overall well-being, working towards a future where every individual has access to this essential resource.
